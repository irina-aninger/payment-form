# payment-form

> A Vue.js project
> This project used the view, as it is convenient to implement on any site based on HTML pages. 
> Due to the reactivity, validation is much faster. Due to the component approach, it is possible to link the form with any product and pull the price and product name, or any other information into the form. 
> It is possible to avoid reloading the page.
